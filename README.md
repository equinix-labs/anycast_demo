# Metal Anycast

Building an Anycast application in 5 minutes on Equinix Metal using Terraform

[Also see my blog: Building a high available Anycast application in 5 minutes on Packet](https://medium.com/@atoonk/building-a-high-available-anycast-application-in-5-minutes-on-packet-198c82eaabc)

_Defining and deploying your applications like we did here, using infrastructure as code and Anycast used to be reserved for the large CDNâ€™s, DNS and major infrastructure providers. Packet now makes it easy for everyone to build high available and low latency infrastructure. Working with Packet has been a great experience and I recommend everyone to give it a spin._

To try this your self:
just clone this repo, add a `something.tfvars` file with your packet API key.
then run:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
and you should be good to go.
